2024-02-27,https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9/main/README.md,"YOLOv9 introduces advancements in object detection, as detailed in its implementation paper titled ""YOLOv9: Learning What You Want to Learn Using Programmable Gradient Information."" It showcases improvements in performance metrics on the MS COCO dataset across various model sizes (S, M, C, E), with the large (E) version achieving an APval of 55.6% and requiring 189.0G FLOPs. The documentation provides comprehensive guidelines for installation, training with single or multiple GPUs, evaluation, and re-parameterization, ensuring accessibility for users. Furthermore, it highlights useful links for custom training, model conversion, inference optimization, and integration with tools like Hugging Face and CoLab. The teaser section hints at partial code release for YOLOR-Based Multi-Task Learning, signaling ongoing development and cross-application potential. Acknowledgements credit significant contributions from several renowned repositories, underscoring the collaborative effort behind YOLOv9's development.",,Machine Learning,,,4784,,,2024-02-18T10:09:29Z
