2024-02-27,https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9/main/README.md,"YOLOv9 is a new advancement in object detection technology presented in the paper ""YOLOv9: Learning What You Want to Learn Using Programmable Gradient Information"". It builds upon the YOLO (You Only Look Once) principle with improvements in performance and efficiency, offering four variants: YOLOv9-S, M, C, and E. These models demonstrate improvement over their predecessors in terms of AP (Average Precision) values across different validation metrics on the MS COCO dataset, with YOLOv9-S being the smallest and YOLOv9-E the most extensive and accurate. The paper details the implementation, training, evaluation, and re-parameterization of these models, and also includes a mention of YOLOR-Based Multi-Task Learning. Installation instructions for a Docker environment, necessary for running YOLOv9, and links to various useful resources for custom training, ONNX export, TensorRT inference, and demonstrations on Hugging Face and CoLab are provided. The publication acknowledges contributions from various related works and projects, highlighting the collaborative nature of advancements in the field of computer vision and deep learning.",YOLOv9 Explained: A Breakthrough in Object Detection Technology,"YOLOv9, the latest update in the YOLO object detection series, introduces programmable gradient information for optimized learning.
