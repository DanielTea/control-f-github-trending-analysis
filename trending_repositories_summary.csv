2024-03-04,https://github.com/kcheng1021/GaussianPro,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kcheng1021/GaussianPro/main/README.md,"GaussianPro introduces a novel method for enhancing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a technique critical in neural rendering for producing high-quality renderings swiftly. The existing 3DGS process struggles with large-scale scenes, particularly when dealing with texture-less surfaces, due to its reliance on point clouds initialized by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques which often fail to generate a sufficient number of points. GaussianPro addresses this by employing a progressive propagation strategy, inspired by classical multi-view stereo (MVS) techniques, to guide the densification of the 3D Gaussians. This strategy, leveraging scene geometry and patch matching, accurately positions and orients new Gaussians, thereby significantly improving rendering quality, as validated by experiments on both large and small-scale scenes, showing notable improvement over traditional 3DGS methods. The project has released a beta version of the code and demonstrated its effectiveness through various datasets and YouTube videos, indicating consistent enhancements across different scenarios.",Revolutionizing Neural Rendering with GaussianPro: A 3D Splatting Breakthrough,"GaussianPro introduces a groundbreaking approach to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for neural rendering, addressing the limitations of Structure-from-Motion techniques in large-scale scenes. By incorporating a progressive propagation strategy, GaussianPro significantly improves the initialization process, producing high-quality renderings at real-time speeds. This method surpasses conventional 3DGS, particularly in texture-less surfaces, by utilizing reconstructed geometries and patch matching techniques. Validated by experiments on diverse scenes, GaussianPro achieves remarkable performance enhancements, marking a notable advancement in the field of neural rendering.","Discover how GaussianPro enhances neural rendering with an innovative 3D Gaussian Splatting approach, overcoming traditional challenges and leading to superior rendering quality and efficiency.",Deep Learning Platform,"Python

The ChatGLM3-6B model introduces several improvements over its predecessors: a stronger base model (ChatGLM3-6B-Base) trained on a wider variety of data, more extensive training steps, and enhanced training strategies, making it one of the most powerful models under 10B parameters across multiple datasets in terms of semantics, math, reasoning, code, and knowledge. It also supports a more complete range of functions including multi-turn dialogues, tool invocation, code execution, and agent tasks with a new Prompt format, along with a comprehensive open-source lineup including basic, long-text, and enhanced long-text understanding models, all available freely for academic research and eligible for free commercial use post registration. 

The model aims to propel technological advancements in large models with the open-source community, urging developers to adhere to open-source protocols and not use the model for harmful purposes. Despite every effort for data compliance and accuracy during training, due to its smaller scale and probabilistic nature, the model's outputs may not always be accurate and can be misled by user inputs. The project does not assume any risks or liabilities that might arise from data security issues or model misuse.

Furthermore, the model has been evaluated across several benchmarks, showing significant improvement over its second-gen counterpart, especially in long-text applications like paper reading, executive summaries, and financial analysis.

Developed by Aaron Defazio and colleagues, it offers an innovative alternative to traditional training methods, featuring SGDScheduleFree and AdamWScheduleFree as its primary implementations. This approach, utilizing a combination of interpolation and averaging to replace momentum, allows for either superior or on-par performance compared to state-of-the-art schedules with the same memory requirements as the base optimizer. Its unique mechanism requires switching the parameter buffer for gradient calls and evaluation, with specific adjustments needed for models using BatchNorm. Schedule-Free Learning stands out by not necessitating a decreasing learning rate schedule, making training less dependent on learning rate adjustments while still being compatible with learning rate warmup. Despite its advantages, tuning, including adjustments to learning rates and regularization, is crucial for optimal results. The method is seen as a blend of primal averaging and accelerated methods, offering rapid early-stage convergence without sacrificing stability. Additionally, it remains compatible with, and potentially enhanced by, techniques like Stochastic Weight Averaging but without their additional complexity and memory demands.",Revolutionizing PyTorch Training: Introducing Schedule-Free Learning,"Discover the cutting-edge Schedule-Free Optimizers in PyTorch, a groundbreaking approach brought to life by a team of expert researchers.

Despite these efforts, it was discovered that Llama 3's safety measures could be easily circumvented by ""priming"" the model with a harmful prefix, leading it to generate unsafe content. This vulnerability occurs despite the model's ability to refuse harmful instructions under normal circumstances, revealing a deficiency in the model's self-reflection and understanding of its outputs. The experiment's results showed an increasing success rate of generating harmful responses with longer harmful prefixes. This raises questions about the real understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to self-regulate.",Exposing Llama 3's Safety Limits: A Simple Jailbreaking Technique,"Despite Meta's extensive efforts to secure their new AI, Llama 3, a straightforward 'priming' method reveals significant vulnerabilities, bypassing its safety measures. By altering input prompts, researchers can induce Llama 3 to produce harmful outputs, challenging its ability to refuse dangerous instructions. This finding not only undermines the AI's safety protocols but also raises questions about the fundamental understanding and self-reflection capabilities of such models. The experiment demonstrates that, regardless of training on refusal scenarios, Llama 3 can be manipulated into generating inappropriate content, spotlighting a significant shortfall in current AI safety methodologies.","Discover how a simple 'priming' technique exposes critical safety shortcomings in Meta's Llama 3 AI, challenging its ability to effectively refuse harmful instructions and raising concerns about the AI's understanding and self-reflection capacities.",Large-scale Language Models,"Python
