It covers a wide range of topics, including principles for keeping the list concise and opinionated, contributions, must-read books like ""The Pragmatic Programmer"" and ""Code Complete,"" and seminal articles offering practical advice to new software engineers and insights into career growth. The list emphasizes resources like books, articles, and courses across various subjects such as algorithms, API design, automation, and data structures, among others. It also addresses developer habits, mindset, debugging, design principles, documentation, and more, underlining the importance of contributing to this list to maintain its relevance and usefulness. The domains it touches upon are vast, including but not limited to coding quality, communication, compilers, cloud services, and system architecture, reflecting the multidimensional nature of software development.",Resource compilation,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlax/professional-programming/master/./images/amazon_writing_rules.jpeg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkTf0LmDqKI; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVVNJKv9esE; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnX3B9oaKzw; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKTxC9pl-WM; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V1FtfBDsLU; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Fbf7R3x6I; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj8bfBlwHAg,36217,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlax/professional-programming/master/./images/amazon_writing_rules.jpeg,,2015-11-07T05:07:52Z
2024-02-21,https://github.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/README.md,"LangChain-Chatchat is an open-source, offline-deployable knowledge base project that enhances retrieval generation (RAG) using ChatGLM and other large language models with frameworks like Langchain. The project, transitioning from Langchain-ChatGLM, will see its last update in the 0.2.x series with version 0.2.10, shifting focus towards the more application-rich 0.3.x series. It aims to provide a supportive, offline-operable knowledge base question-answering solution for Chinese scenarios using open-source models. Inspired by projects like document.ai and contributions to ChatGLM-6B, it utilizes various models such as Vicuna, Alpaca, LLaMA, Koala, RWKV, accessible through FastAPI or a Streamlit-based WebUI. It supports fully localized inference, addressing data security and private deployment issues, with support for major local language and embedding models, and open-source local vector databases. Setup involves environment configuration, model downloading, initializing the knowledge base and configuration files, and a one-click startup. The project has reached significant milestones, including a transition to Langchain-Chatchat, and aims for enhancements in the upcoming 0.3.x series.",Knowledge base project,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/img/logo-long-chatchat-trans-v2.png; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/img/langchain+chatglm.png; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/img/langchain+chatglm2.png; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/img/fastapi_docs_026.png; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/img/LLM_success.png; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/img/init_knowledge_base.jpg,,22591,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/img/logo-long-chatchat-trans-v2.png; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/img/langchain+chatglm.png; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/img/langchain+chatglm2.png; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/img/fastapi_docs_026.png; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/img/LLM_success.png; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat/master/img/init_knowledge_base.jpg,,2023-03-31T12:12:45Z
